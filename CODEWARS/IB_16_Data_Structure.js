complexity' for adding or editing or removing records.

a queue may be thought of as a conatainer of source where records or pieces of
data enter on one end of this container and then exit on the other. A queue is
like waiting in line to do sth.

Enqueuing (adding) - the process of adding a record into a queue
Dequeuing (removing) - taking sth out the queue

Queue follows First-in-First out principle (F-I-F-O).
